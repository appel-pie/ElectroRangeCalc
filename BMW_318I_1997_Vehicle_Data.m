##~100km range with mixed highway and city driving.

##Oddly range seems to increase with highway driving, Iâ€™ve done 117km with 7% remaining @ 95km/h whereas
##I struggle to get 100km round the suburbs. (Although the suburbs round here are quite hilly)

% Model Returns 119. I think bmws cd number is a bit optimistic. i also am guessing the vehicle converted
